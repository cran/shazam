\title{The shazam package}
\description{
Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable 
large-scale characterization of Ig repertoires, defined as the collection of transmembrane 
antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of T and B lymphocytes. The \code{shazam}
package provides tools for advanced analysis of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in
immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences. The key functions in \code{shazam}, broken down topic, are 
described below.
}
\section{Mutational profiling}{

\code{shazam} provides tools to quantify the extent and nature of SHM within
full length V(D)J sequences as well as sub-regions (eg, FWR and CDR).
Quantification of expected mutational loaded, under specific SHM targeting 
models, can also be performed along with model driven simulations of SHM.

\itemize{
  \item  \link{collapseClones}:           Build clonal consensus sequence.
  \item  \link{observedMutations}:        Compute observed mutation counts and frequencies.
  \item  \link{expectedMutations}:        Compute expected mutation frequencies.
  \item  \link{shmulateSeq}:              Simulate mutations in a single sequence.
  \item  \link{shmulateTree}:             Simulate mutations over a lineage tree.
}
}

\section{SHM targeting models}{

Computational models and analyses of SHM have separated the process 
into two independent components: 
\enumerate{
  \item  A mutability model that defines where mutations occur.
  \item  A nucleotide substitution model that defines the resulting mutation.
}
Collectively these are what form the targeting model of SHM. \code{shazam} 
provides empirically derived targeting models for both humans and mice,
along with tools to build these mutability and substitution models from data.

\itemize{
  \item  \link{createTargetingModel}:     Build a 5-mer targeting model.
  \item  \link{plotMutability}:           Plot 5-mer mutability rates.
  \item  \link{HH_S5F}:                Human 5-mer SHM targeting model.
  \item  \link{MK_RS5NF}:              Mouse 5-mer SHM targeting model.
}
}

\section{Quantification of selection pressure}{

Bayesian Estimation of Antigen-driven Selection in Ig Sequences is a 
novel method for quantifying antigen-driven selection in high-throughput
Ig sequence data. Targeting models created using \code{shazam} can be used 
to estimate the null distribution of expected mutation frequencies used
by BASELINe, providing measures of selection pressure informed by known 
AID targeting biases.
             
\itemize{
  \item  \link{calcBaseline}:             Calculate the BASELINe probability
                                          density functions (PDFs).
  \item  \link{groupBaseline}:            Combine PDFs from sequences grouped
                                          by biological or experimental relevance.
  \item  \link{summarizeBaseline}:        Compute summary statistics from BASELINe PDFs.
  \item  \link{testBaseline}:             Perform significance testing for the difference
                                          between BASELINe PDFs.
  \item  \link{plotBaselineDensity}:      Plot the probability density functions
                                          resulting from selection analysis.
  \item  \link{plotBaselineSummary}:      Plot summary stastistics resulting from 
                                          selection analysis.

\section{Mutational distance calculation}{

\code{shazam} provides tools to compute evolutionary distances between 
sequences or groups of sequences, which can leverage SHM targeting 
models. This information is particularly useful in understanding and 
defining clonal relationships.
             
\itemize{
  \item  \link{findThreshold}:            Identify clonal assignment threshold based on 
                                          distances to nearest neighbors.
  \item  \link{distToNearest}:            Tune clonal assignment thresholds by calculating 
                                          distances to nearest neighbors.
  \item  \link{calcTargetingDistance}:    Construct a nucleotide distance matrix from a 
                                          5-mer targeting model.
