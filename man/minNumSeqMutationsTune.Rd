\title{Parameter tuning for minNumSeqMutations}
\usage{
minNumSeqMutationsTune(mutCount, minNumSeqMutationsRange)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutCount}{a \code{vector} of length 1024 returned by 
\link{createMutabilityMatrix} with \code{numSeqMutationsOnly=TRUE}.}

\item{minNumSeqMutationsRange}{a number or a vector indicating the value or the range of values 
of \code{minNumSeqMutations} to try.}
}
\value{
A 2xn \code{matrix}, where n is the number of trial values of \code{minNumSeqMutations}
             supplied in \code{minNumSeqMutationsRange}. Each column corresponds to a value
             in \code{minNumSeqMutationsRange}. The rows correspond to the number of 5-mers
             for which mutability would be computed directly (\code{"measured"}) and inferred
             (\code{"inferred"}), respectively.
}
\description{
\code{minNumSeqMutationsTune} helps with picking a threshold value for \code{minNumSeqMutations}
in \link{createMutabilityMatrix} by tabulating the number of 5-mers for which 
mutability would be computed directly or inferred at various threshold values.
}
\details{
At a given threshold value of \code{minNumSeqMutations}, for a given 5-mer,
             if the total number of mutations is greater than the threshold, mutability 
             is computed directly. Otherwise, mutability is inferred.
