One of \code{"gmm"} or \code{"density"}. See Details for methodological
descriptions.}

Gaussian fit parameters. Default value is 90% of the entries (0.9).

\value{
\itemize{
  \item \code{"gmm"} method:      Returns a \link{GmmThreshold} object including the  
                                  \code{threshold} and the function fit parameters, i.e.
                                  mixing weight, mean, and standard deviation of a Normal distribution, or 
                                  mixing weight, shape and scale of a Gamma distribution.
  \item \code{"density"} method:  Returns a \link{DensityThreshold} object including the optimum 
                                  \code{threshold} and the density fit parameters.

\description{
\code{findThreshold} automtically determines an optimal threshold for clonal assignment of
Ig sequences using a vector of nearest neighbor distances. It provides two alternative methods 
using either a Gamma/Gaussian Mixture Model fit (\code{method="gmm"}) or kernel density 
fit (\code{method="density"}).
}
\details{
\itemize{ 
  \item \code{"gmm"}:     Performs a maximum-likelihood fitting procedure, for learning 
                          the parameters of two mixture univariate, either Gamma or Gaussian, distributions 
                          which fit the bimodal distribution entries. Retrieving the fit parameters, 
                          it then calculates the optimum threshold \code{method="optimal"}, where the 
                          average of the sensitivity plus specificity reaches its maximum. In addition, 
                          the \code{findThreshold} function is also able 
                          to calculate the intersection point (\code{method="intersect"}) of the two fitted curves 
                          and allows the user to invoke its value as the cut-off point, instead of optimal point.
  \item \code{"density"}: Fits a binned approximation to the ordinary kernel density estimate
                          to the nearest neighbor distances after determining the optimal
                          bandwidth for the density estimate via least-squares cross-validation of 
                          the 4th derivative of the kernel density estimator. The optimal threshold
                          is set as the minimum value in the valley in the density estimate
                          between the two modes of the distribution.
}
}
\note{
Visually inspecting the resulting distribution fits is strongly recommended when using 
either fitting method. Empirical observations imply that the bimodality 
of the distance-to-nearest distribution is detectable for a minimum of 1,000 distances.
Larger numbers of distances will improve the fitting procedure, although this can come 
at the expense of higher computational demands.
